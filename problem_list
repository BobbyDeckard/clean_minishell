[update on 23.09.2025: everything seems to work]

Parsing:
-	Make sure spaces don't flag errors with special characters (beware of $ and redirs' specific behaviour)
-	Concatenate the content of quotes ?
-	Try again to have a correct way of handling AST building errors ? (i.e. freeing all malloc'ed nodes without cheating with exit() )
-	Using strlcat instead of strlcpy on uninit'ed strings may be prone to errors ?

-	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	The current implementation of the expander does not work properly.
	For example, cat file || echo $? should print 1 if cat file fails, but currently, $? would be expanded with atoi on the last exit_status in memory AT PARSING TIME, not on the call of echo 
	I vaguely remember having it figured out but how??
	BUT this need to be applied on every variable, otherwise a command like unset USER && echo $USER would still print USER
	=> A solution could start by leaving the $ sign in the command arguments and applying an adaptation of the expander there
	Then is it really useful to tokenize them as env_var or exit_status...?
