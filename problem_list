Parsing:
-	Word parsing excludes some characters that should be included:
	ex: echo "hello'" -> cmd.args = {"echo", "hello"} instead of {"echo", "hello'"}
	=> will print
		hello
	instead of
		hello'
	BUT open parentheses are considered an error, and unmatched quotes outside matching quotes open some sort of heredoc (don't need to implement it right ?)

	SO if we are inside matching quotes, we should add the quote char as part of the word

-	What happens to spaces inside words ? ex: echo hello there
	=> especially if we have to concat special characters inside words, need to adjust to the presence/absence of a space character (or any other special characters I would say)

	=> Maybe do something where inside quotes we only have 1 "word" including spaces since it's the only place where we would concat special characters ?

	BEWARE of $
