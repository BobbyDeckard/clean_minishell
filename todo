TODO
o	Check if we want to try and remove empty args
o	get_name_len gives us 1 too much ?
	=> only when first getting name ?
o	Check how bash behaves with different types of contiguous whitespaces
	=> We currently only filter regular spaces (=32)
o	Check that echo $"USER" behaves the same on school's bash
o	Battery testing
o	Chase those leaks (and conditional moves on unset variables ??)

DONE
x	Check export's parsing with quotes (both single and double quotes)
x	Concatenation of contiguous args is not working
	=> Which is obviously why export is not working
x	Weird stuff: echo hey  there (only removes one space)
x	Check exit issue with exit [numeric] [alphabetic]:
	=> [alphabetic] is printed in front of the prompt..?
x	echo $"USER" behaves strangely
x	Be absolutely sure the second stage parsing in expander works properly!
	x	echo "$USR" still has extra arg ?
	x	echo $"USER" works ?
	x	echo hello"$USER"world
		=> world is not cat
	x	Find a way to correctly parse echo hello " " there without removing the quoted space
x	Apply expander changes to all variations
x	Dive into heredoc problems
	x	Heredoc expansion fails to be called
