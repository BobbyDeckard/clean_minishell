DONE:
X.	Check semicolons, maybe as simple as defining them as the root node
=>	Subject explicitly says we do NOT need to handle semicolons.
X.	Check multiple redirs
	=> peut-être les mettre en série dans children de cmd ? vu que c'est la dernière redir qui fait foi
=>	Once again, AST supremacy had the solution ready to be implemented without having to think about it.






TO DO ASAP:
FIX PIPES ????!??!???!!!! TT






TO DO:
O.	Fix unset
O.	Replace every justified malloc with a calloc
O.	When we remove an arg caused by nonexistent var we should also remove the corresponding exp entry
O.	Check comments left in exec with norminette
O.	Check behaviour for echo $USER, something, wondering about that comma...
	=> Test:
	[input] > echo Hi this is $USER, nice to meet you
	[bash output] > Hi this is ivo, nice to meet you
	[hell output] > Hi this is ivo nice to meet you
0.	Maybe just get rid of the "_=..." env variable...
