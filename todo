DONE:
X.	Check semicolons, maybe as simple as defining them as the root node
=>	Subject explicitly says we do NOT need to handle semicolons.
X.	Check multiple redirs
	=> peut-être les mettre en série dans children de cmd ? vu que c'est la dernière redir qui fait foi
=>	Once again, AST supremacy had the solution ready to be implemented without having to think about it.

TO DO:
O.	Replace every justified malloc with a calloc
O.	Check comments left in exec with norminette
O.	PINAILLAGE: signals with heredoc: when C^D, the given input should be considered WITH the preceding '>' character followed by a space at the beginning of lines, + our version gives a warining nonexistent in bash
	+ when C^C, should not print ^C
O.	Check quotes and expansion...
O.	echo Hello I'm $USER, nice to meet you
	leads to a segfault

Problems with expander:
O.	Check behaviour for echo $USER, something, wondering about that comma...
	=> Test:
	[input] > echo Hi this is $USER, nice to meet you
	[bash output] > Hi this is ivo, nice to meet you
	[hell output] > Hi this is ivo nice to meet you
O.	We should maybe not separate arguments containing env vars in order to print them right with the spaces
