TODO
o	Be absolutely sure the second stage parsing in expander works properly!
	x	echo "$USR" still has extra arg ?
	x	echo $"USER" works ?
	o	echo hello"$USER"world
		=> world is not cat
	o	Find a way to correctly parse echo hello " " there without removing the quoted space
o	Check how bash behaves with different types of contiguous whitespaces
	=> We currently only filter regular spaces (=32)
o	echo $"USER" behaves strangely
	=> bash 3.2 on MacOS only prints USER, check on school's computers
o	Dive into heredoc problems
	o	To begin with, make it so that the delimiter works...
o	Battery testing
o	Chase those leaks (and conditional moves on unset variables ??)

DONE
x	Check export's parsing with quotes (both single and double quotes)
x	Concatenation of contiguous args is not working
	=> Which is obviously why export is not working
x	Weird stuff: echo hey  there (only removes one space)
x	Check exit issue with exit [numeric] [alphabetic]:
	=> [alphabetic] is printed in front of the prompt..?
