TODO
o	echo $"USER" behaves strangely
o	Check exit issue with exit [numeric] [alphabetic]:
	=> [alphabetic] is printed in front of the prompt..?
o	Dive into heredoc problems
	=> To begin with, make it so that the delimiter works...
o	Battery testing
o	Chase those leaks (and conditional moves on unset variables ??)

DONE
x	Check export's parsing with quotes (both single and double quotes)
x	Concatenation of contiguous args is not working
	=> Which is obviously why export is not working
x	Weird stuff: echo hey  there (only removes one space)
